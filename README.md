# Real-time Automotive Engine Sound Simulation with Deep Neural Network

This is the repository providing the synthesized engine sound for comparison. In addition, the database and the code will also be released in the future. 


## Brief introduction

Our method includes a sample-based method, a procedural method, and a hybrid method combining the sample-based and procedural methods.
